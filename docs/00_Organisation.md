## Download

Download this repository as a zip, and unpack. Copy the files to a web server that can run PHP 5.3 or greater. You can also run the documentation locally using Grunt.js, which is covered at the end of this readme.

## Folders

By default, the generator will look for folders in the `/docs` folder. Add your folders inside the `/docs` folder. This project contains some example folders and files to get you started.

**Good:**

* 01_Getting_Started.md = Getting Started
* API_Calls.md = API Calls
* 200_Something_Else-Cool.md = Something Else-Cool

**Bad:**

* File Name With Space.md = FAIL

## Sorting

To sort your files and folders in a specific way, you can prefix them with a number and underscore, e.g. `/docs/01_Hello_World.md` and `/docs/05_Features.md` This will list *Hello World* before *Features*, overriding the default alpha-numeric sorting. The numbers will be stripped out of the navigation and urls.

## Landing page

If you want to create a beautiful landing page for your project, simply create a `index.md` file in the root of the `/docs` folder. This file will then be used to create a landing page. You can also add a tagline and image to this page using the config file like this:

```json
{
	"title": "Daux.io",
	"tagline": "The Easiest Way To Document Your Project",
	"image": "img/app.png"
}
```
